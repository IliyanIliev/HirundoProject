    <description>You need some basic cryptographic functionality to secure data from within your application, but have no clue what ASN.1 or X.509 is? You don't want your code to contain a lot of lines of code that handle byte[], streams, and other weird object types that have nothing to do with your actual business logic? 
This library takes care about all details without messing up your code and without requiring you to be a guru in cryptography and computer science.

ECSigner and ECKeyPair 
Public key cryptography for signing using elliptic curves.

RSASigner and RSAKeyPar
Public key cryptography for signing using the RSA algorithm and RIPE160.

Hash
Secure Hashing using MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, Whirlpool, RIPEMD-160, and RIPEMD-320. 

+others.

Please be aware that the functionality of this library is limited by design! It is aimed to hide the complexity of cryptography and it is not about flexibility and/or features! Most of our code uses the Bouncy Castle C# API (see http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/), so if you need flexibility and all the features in the world, please go for Bouncy Castle.</description>
